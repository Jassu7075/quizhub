## 🚀 Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a seamless, interactive testing environment. It focuses on clean state management, responsive design, and efficient data handling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **React & TypeScript:** For building a robust, type-safe component architecture.
* **Vite:** For ultra-fast development and optimized builds.
* **Tailwind CSS & shadcn-ui:** For a modern, corporate "Glassmorphism" UI.
* **AI Collaboration (Lovable.dev):** I utilized **Lovable AI** as a high-velocity development partner to scaffold the UI and accelerate the initial component generation, allowing me to focus on core logic, performance tuning, and custom features.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Progress Tracking:** Visual feedback for the user throughout the quiz.
* **Custom Timer Logic:** Integrated countdown timer per question to simulate real exam conditions.
* **Category-Based Logic:** Designed to handle different question sets (e.g., Python, C#, Cloud).
* **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive across all devices.

## 👨‍💻 My Development Workflow
As the lead developer, my process involved:
1.  **Architecture Design:** Defining the data structure for questions and state flow.
2.  **AI-Assisted Scaffolding:** Using **Lovable AI** to rapidly generate the initial frontend components.
3.  **Manual Refinement:** Customizing the TypeScript interfaces, fixing logic bugs, and integrating the specific "Pro-level" features like the timer and scoring system.
4.  **Version Control:** Managing the project via Git and GitHub for continuous deployment.
